What is SNOWFLAKE?

SNOWFLAKE is a BEP20 token that is deployed on the Binance Smart Chain. This token has no utility, and nothing is planned for it. Consider it a store of value, that has little value (so far). The dev has 2,500,000 SNOW for his contribution in creating the token, as well as another 2,500,000 to an aquiantance who helped set up the project. The code is about as simple as it gets. It was taken directly from Binances template and modified for the use of this token. The mint function is simply in the event of an error, and will never be used to create tokens for any other reason other then to rectify an issue (human or not). Many other large projects have this feeature (SAFEMOON).
